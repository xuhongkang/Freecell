# Freecell
### From CS3500 Object Oriented Design
Instructor: Clark Freifeld
Developer: Hongkang Xu

In this assignment, we were asked to implement a model-view-controller design of the Freecell game with multi-move functionalities in Java, using an object-oriented approach with extensive testing and strict coding style formats. This implementation accepts input via the jdk console and runs an asynchronous game (meaning that the console stalls to wait for input) of Freecell. 

As exra credit, we were also provided with html and css style documents, as well as linked javascript files to complete. This freecell implementation can run in the browser and supports autoclick as well as multi-move. Total time spent on both assignments exceeded 15 hours.
